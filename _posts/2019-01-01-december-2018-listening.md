With the New Year around the corner, December was a very introspective month for me. Although I can't claim to be any wiser going into 2019, I enter the year with a sense of contentedness and peaceful acceptance of life and its associated challenges.

This month's playlist features a wider variety of genres than previous months as I attempted to emerge from the echo chamber of Spotify's recommendation engine. (Turns out, there is such a thing as too much contemporary R&B).

Enjoy!
